# Coursework-Projects

Hello and welcome!
This repo contains the two courses' project from the last term. One is a great course Machine Learning on Coursera, given by Prof. Andrew Ng. Another course is Natrual Language Processing I took in Peking University.

Both projects contain .pdf documents act as result report. And sorry for the hard-coded path and only a little annotation. Most of the project I built from scratch just for learning the principle, and very immature comparing current open source library. I will carry on learning.
